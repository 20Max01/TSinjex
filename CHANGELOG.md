## [Unreleased]

  Deprecated RegisterInstance in favor of Register, which now internally handles instance registration.
  Added support for marking dependencies as deprecated with a warning logged upon first resolution.
  Updated documentation with examples and notes on deprecation.
- tests: add mode parameter to RegisterInstanceDecorator
  Introduced a mode parameter to the test_RegisterInstanceDecorator function allowing 'instance' or 'standalone' modes.
  Updated test cases to utilize the new mode parameter when registering an instance.
  Disabled specific ESLint rule in Decorators.test.ts for deprecation warnings.
  Added an additional test call to test_RegisterInstanceDecorator with 'instance' mode.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Add pre release building to release workflow on dev/* branches an version changes.
- feat: Introduced a new CLI command `tsinjex-generate` to automate the generation of import statements for registered dependencies.  
  The command scans `.ts` files for `@Register` and `@RegisterInstance` decorators and generates an `auto-imports.ts` file.  
  This ensures that all registered dependencies are automatically included without requiring manual imports.  
  The CLI can be executed via `npx tsinjex-generate` or added as a script in `package.json` for easier integration.
